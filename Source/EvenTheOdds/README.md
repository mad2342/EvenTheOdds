# EvenTheOdds

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] The OpFor will utilize advanced equipment just as the player does.

## Gameplay changes
* Depending on progress in campaign/career the enemy lances will have one or more Mechs with higher tier equipment
    * These Mechs will most likely be piloted by elite mechwarriors
* Priority missions also have some of their predefined enemies replaced by custom Mechs/Pilots
* Salvage generation is adjusted to keep game balance intact
* Contract difficulty variance is customized and adjusted depending on progress and GameType (Campaign/Career)
    * This will allow for a wider difficulty spread especially in/after the campaign
